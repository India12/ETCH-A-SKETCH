Project: Etch-A-Sketch:
- to improve DOM manipulation skills.
- to improve CSS Grid understanding and usage.

TODO:
- fix the function 'darken()' - 'reset()': reset button doesn'work as expected - after click on 'darken button' to reset grid (clear color), darken() doesn't start counting from zero.
